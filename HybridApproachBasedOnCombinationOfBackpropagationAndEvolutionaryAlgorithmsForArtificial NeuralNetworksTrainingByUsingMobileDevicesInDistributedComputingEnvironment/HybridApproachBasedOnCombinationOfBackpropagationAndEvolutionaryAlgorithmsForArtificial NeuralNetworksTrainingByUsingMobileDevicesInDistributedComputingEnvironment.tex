\begin{abstract}
When Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are used for Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) training, the most valuable advantage is the potential for this training to be done in parallel or even using distributed computing. With the capabilities of modern mobile devices, for example their use for distributed computations, they can be used much more extensively for scientific calculations. It is well known that distributed computing systems are limited by their communication bandwidth, because of network latency. In such environment some EAs are pretty suitable for distributed implementation. This is because of their high level of parallelism and relatively less intensive network communication needs. Subset of distributed computing is volunteer computing where users donate some of the computing power provided by devices under their control. This research proposes Android Live Wallpaper volunteer computing implementation of a system used for financial time series prediction. The forecasting module is organized as ANN, which is trained by hybrid combination of Backpropagation and EAs.

\section{Introduction}
%
ANNs are very common in the field of machine learning. In its nature ANN training is an optimization problem. When the searching space is too big EAs for global optimization as Genetic Algorithms (GAs) can be very suitable. In the last two decades there are alot of attempts to combine EAs based optimization with the ANNs training. This combination shows to be much more promising when it is implemented as distributed computing system [2,5,6]. With the rising popularity of the mobile devices a lot of new possibilities for distributed computing can be investigated. Successful desktop distributed computing projects [3,4] can be efficiently implemented on mobile devices. This idea can be applied on EA based ANN training into a mobile distributed computing environment [1]. In this paper genetic algorithm in combination with backpropagation artificial neural network training is described. The training is done on a mobile devices as active Android wallpaper application. In addition, the traditional ANN's sigmoid function is replaced by fading sinusoidal function. The successful application of this hybrid approach is documented by series of experiments.

This paper is organized as follows. Section 1 gives an overview of the problem  with a special emphasis on ANNs/GAs and their strengths/weaknesses when applied for the problem's solution. Section 2 introduces a distributed computing environment based on mobile devices. Experiments and results are presented in Section 3. The final Section 4 concludes and some further work suggestions are provided.
