ABSTRACT

This study addresses application of population based optimization heuristics to the solution of packing problems as part of optimal cutting tasks in the field of operations research. Such problems are very common in the industrial material cutting. It has one, two or three dimensional variations. 

The focus of this paper is on two dimensional case of steel sheet cutting. A description of two dimensional plates is supplied as algorithm input. The output of the algorithm is coordinates of the plates in the steel sheet and angle of rotation for each plate. Population based global optimization heuristics are used for optimal packing. All experiments are done with open source libraries for 2D geometry and population based heuristics.
