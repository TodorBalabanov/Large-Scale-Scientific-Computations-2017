1. Citation of [10] was corrected on page 3, section 2.
2. Length and the width of the best achieved solution was added in section 4.
3. The useful area used in the steel sheet was also reported in section 4.
4. Problem is well defined in the original ESGI proposals. The papers are publicly available.
5. Genetic algorithms are not very efficient according time consummationon that is why the study is limited to few experiments. The source code of the experiments is publicly available. Each reader can repeat the experiments as much times as he/she wants. 
6. Other exact numbers solutions were not provided in ESGI113 and ESGI120 that is why the results were not compared with other solutions.
7. Maximum execution time was reported in section 4.
